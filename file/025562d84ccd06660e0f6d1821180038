Jacobs lead the profession in providing seamless Enforcement and Debt Collection services by working in partnership with our Local Authority and Commercial clients.

The Partners, Simon Jacobs and Paula Jacobs, have led the organisation for over 25 years supported by a dynamic, experienced and specialist Management team, ensuring our services are fit for purpose and provide the best quality, performance and innovation, with year on year improvement.
<br>
<br>
To demonstrate our understanding of the Public Sector Market, our Client Management and Development teams are all former Local Authority Senior Managers. This brings additional specialist understanding of Local Authority requirements.
<br>
<br>
Jacobs is a family firm with the right qualities and ethos at the centre of all we do, and despite considerable growth over the last decade making us a large national firm, we still hold our core values to work in true partnership and as an extension to our clients’ services.

<h1 class = 'subtitle'>Tailored Services</h1>

Jacobs collect multiple debt types including all Local Taxation, Parking and Corporate debt. We understand that Councils require a corporate debt approach which still permits implementation of service-specific strategies. 
<br>
<br>
All recovery and enforcement processes are fully tailored to individual client requirements. We capture your guidelines and specifications on contract commencement and monitor the service through our performance management framework.
<br>
<br>
<h1 class = 'subtitle'>Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007</h1>

The introduction of the Tribunals Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 and subsequent Statutory Instruments have provided us with a great opportunity to review every process and procedure, and remap in line with the changes introduced. 
<br>
<br>
The new regulations have been a major success, having revolutionised and modernised the way we collect outstanding debt. Jacobs comprehensive planning for the implementation of the new regulations, in addition to the reengineering of all key processes and the introduction of new technology and innovations aimed to maximise customer engagement throughout the process, has demonstrated that we are one of the highest collectors in the compliance stage. 
<br>
<br>
We believe that ‘early compliance is key’ to ensuring that we have an effective Compliance Stage which maximises customer contact and reduces the number of cases escalating to the Enforcement Stage. This ensures improved cash flow for clients and it keeps costs low for customers.
<br>
<br>
Jacobs enforcement agents are all trained, experienced, certificated in the county court, and are required to study and pass the IRRV/CIVEA examinations.
<br>
<br>
All agents provide a local service ensuring local knowledge and speed of response. Using the latest technology on the doorstep, including iPads for efficient routing and allocation of cases, updating and recording information in real time, and Video Badges for transparency, the agent has accurate and up to date information and instructions at all times, Jacobs therefore have the most effective enforcement stage process, comprising of timely visits, up to date information, and dynamic back office support through specialist teams and support staff.
<br>
<br>
<h1 class = 'subtitle'>Technology and Innovation</h1>

Innovation and new initiatives are at the centre of all we do, and we work closely with our clients to ensure we automate, reduce administration and deliver real cost savings in a seamless and joined up collaboration in service delivery.
<br>
<br>
Jacobs are proud to have developed, in-house by our Systems Development team, Aneris. Aneris is our continuously growing suite of in-house operational technologies.
<br>
<br>
Developed between 2011 and 2013, Aneris Perform is a performance management solution completely unique to the debt recovery industry. The application dynamically pulls data from our data-sources, running unique calculations to provide our clients with transparent in-depth statistics and analysis. 
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
