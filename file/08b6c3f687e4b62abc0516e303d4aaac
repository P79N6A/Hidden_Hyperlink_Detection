       <p>Do you like coke? Do you know we can cook chicken with it? And does it have anything to do with our mobile phones? The latest cell phone, the “Coke Phone”, by the Chinese designer Daizi Zheng is a surprise.</p>
       <p>Daizi Zheng is a famous designer in England. The Nokia company asked her to design a phone that is not bad for the environment. As a result of her research, she found that normal phone batteries are expensive and bad for the environment. It also uses many good resources（资源）to make a normal battery. So she wanted to design a battery that is green. Then a Nokia cellphone that drinks coke was born.</p>
       <p>The cell phone has a bio-battery（生物电池）.It gets power from sugar. So users only need to pour a glass of coke into it, and then watch the coke turn into power. Once the battery dies, only oxygen and water are left. Bio-batteries can last three to four times longer than the usual batteries. In fact, Zheng said that not only coke but also soda（苏打）with sugar can be good resources to power the cell phone.</p>
       <p>If so, you may never look at a can of coke in the same way again.</p>
       <p>106. The “Coke Phone” is the ________ cell phone that is designed ________ a Chinese girl.</p>
       <p>107. The normal phone batteries are ________and do ________ to the environment. 108. The Chinese girl designed a bio-battery to________ the ________of a normal phone battery.</p>
       <p>109. Coke and soda with sugar can ________ the “Coke Phone” ________ power.</p>
       <p>110. From the passage, we know coke has ______ use besides being used to _____ and a drink.</p>
       <p>106. latest, by 107. expensive, harm 108. take, place 109. provide, with</p>
       <p>110. another, cook</p>

       <p>Nadya Vessey was born with an illness and her legs would never grow. At the age of 16, both of her legs below (低于) the knees were cut off. Nadya Vessey hasn’t let that destroy her. She recently changed herself into a mermaid (美人鱼).</p>
       <p>It was a little boy that started Nadya’s change. One day a little boy saw her take</p>
       <p>off her prosthetic (修复术的) legs and asked her why she didn’t have any legs. After thinking quickly, she asked him whether he had heard of The Little Mermaid. He said</p>
       <p>The idea of a mermaid became clearer and clearer in Nadya’s mind. After thinking it over, she wrote to the Weta Workshop two years ago, asking if they could make her a prosthetic tail (尾巴). She was surprised to get the reply that they agreed. The Weta Workshop’s director was happy to make it happen and wanted Nadya to be beautiful. It took the Weta Workshop two years to make a special suit for Nadya. After practicing in the local swimming pool, Nadya went to the open sea and tried out her mermaid suit. Nadya was pleased with it.</p>

       <p>九年级英语阅读理解专项练习</p>
       <p>（一）</p>
       <p>When you are learning English, you find it not clever to translate</p>
       <p>an English sentence, word for word, into your own language. Take the</p>
       <p>sentence “How do you do?” for example. If you look up each word in the</p>
       <p>dictionary, one at a time, what is your translation? It must be a wrong</p>
       <p>sentence in your own language.</p>
       <p>Languages don’t just have different sounds, they are different in</p>
       <p>many ways. It’s important to master the rules for word order in the study</p>
       <p>of English, too. If the speakers put words in a wrong order , the listener</p>
       <p>can’t understand the speaker’s sentence easily. Sometimes when the order</p>
       <p>of words in an English sentence is changed, the meaning of the sentence</p>
       <p>changes. But sometimes the order is changed, the meaning of the sentence</p>
       <p>doesn’t change between the two pairs of sentences:</p>
       <p>“She only likes apples.” “Only she likes apples.”</p>
       <p>“I have seen the film already.” “I have already seen the film.”</p>
       <p>When you are learning English, you must do your best to get the spirit</p>
       <p>of the language and use it as the English speaker does.</p>
       <p>( )1.From the passage we know that when we are learning</p>
       <p>English.</p>
       <p>A.we shouldn’t put every word into our language</p>
       <p>B.we should look up every word it the dictionary</p>
       <p>C.we need to put every word into our own language</p>
       <p>( )2.We can learn from the passage that .</p>
       <p>A.if the order of words is different, the meaning of the sentence must</p>
       <p>be different</p>
       <p>B.the order of words can never change the meaning of an English sentence</p>
       <p>C.sometimes different order of words has a different meaning</p>
       <p>( )3. “She only likes apples.” .</p>
       <p>A.is the same as “Only she likes apples.”</p>
       <p>B.is different from “Only she likes apples.”</p>
       <p>C means “She likes fruit except apples.”</p>
       <p>( )4. Which of the following is TRUE?</p>
       <p>A. The order of words can’t be changed</p>
       <p>B. We should know the rules for word order when we study English</p>
       <p>C. It’s important for us to translate an English sentence word for word</p>
       <p>( )5.What’s the meaning of the underlined word “spirit”?</p>
       <p>A. 心情 B.本意 C.灵魂</p>
       <p></p>
       <p>（二）</p>
       <p>A good reader is very much like a driver. He must change his reading</p>
       <p>speed to fit his purpose and the material he is reading, just as a driver</p>
       <p>does fit the road situation. A good reader may be able to read a thousand</p>
       <p>words per minute (WPM) , but he won’t use that speed for everything he</p>
       <p></p>
       <p>reads. A good reader doing research reading in the library may read at</p>
       <p>the speed of 1,000 words per minute as he looks for materials for a report.</p>
       <p>But once he finds something that is useful to him, he may need to slow</p>
       <p>down to 100 WPM . A good reader may read newspaper and magazine articles</p>
       <p>at 600 WPM . But it may take him 150 WPM to read his science or maths</p>
       <p>text . Just as a driver has a wide change of speed , so has a good reader .</p>
       <p>( )1.According to the writer , good readers can .</p>
       <p>A. read at 1,000 WPM B.spend more time reading</p>
       <p>C.change the speed as needed</p>
       <p>( )2.The passage tells us that the speed of reading</p>
       <p>depends on</p>
       <p>a.the number of books</p>
       <p>b.the purpose of reading</p>
       <p>c.the time when you’re reading</p>
       <p>d.the material that you’re reading</p>
       <p>e.the place where you’re reading</p>
       <p>A. a and b B. b and d C. b , c and d</p>
       <p>( )3.A good reader may use the highest speed of reading</p>
       <p>when .</p>
       <p>A. he is trying to find materials for his report</p>
       <p>B.he is trying to work out a math problem</p>
       <p>C. he reads the material most useful to him</p>
       <p>( )4.The passage suggests that a good driver should .</p>
       <p>A.be able to driver at a high speed</p>
       <p>B.be good at driving on a country road</p>
       <p>C.be good at changing driving speed</p>
       <p>( )5.This passage is mainly about .</p>
       <p>A.the importance of having different reading speed</p>
       <p>B.the relation（关系）between reading and driving speed</p>
       <p>C. the difference between driving and reading</p>
       <p>（三）</p>

       <p>It was already late when we started for the next town. It was about</p>
       <p>15 miles away on the other side of the hill. There we felt sure that we</p>
       <p>would find a bed for the night . Darkness fell along the narrow road to</p>
       <p>the hill. As we climbed higher, it became colder and rain began to fall.</p>
       <p>It was difficult at times to see the road, so I asked my friend John</p>
       <p>to drive slowly.</p>
       <p>Now we traveled for about 20miles but we could not find the town. We</p>
       <p>were beginning to feel worried. Then the car stopped. We found we were</p>
       <p>out of petrol, so we decided to spend the night in the car.</p>
       <p>After eating some bread, I tried to go to sleep at once, but John, a</p>
       <p>poor sleeper, got out of the car after a few minutes and went for a walk</p>
       <p>up the hill. Soon he came running back. From the top of the hill he had</p>
       <p>seen the lights of the town in the valley below. We at once tried to push</p>
       <p>car to the top of the hill. In less than an hour we were in the town,</p>
       <p>and we found a hotel there easily.</p>
       <p>1. The car stopped because___________.</p>

       <p>（一） The China’s Got Talent</p>
       <p>中国达人秀</p>
       <p>Last Sunday evening I watched the China’s Got Talent</p>
       <p>on East TV. It was wonderful, I think. Many player took part</p>
       <p>in the China’s Got Talent. The host Chen Lei was a special</p>
       <p>character person, I think. I like him very much. The program</p>
       <p>was being held in an atmosphere(气氛) of active and</p>
       <p>hot. Many audience likes his program.</p>
       <p>During the program, all audience were happy and exciting. From his column, we could find many wonderful person. There were young or old person, girls or boys, men or women. They were too fantastic. I felt it was the most happy time in my life</p>
       <p>（二）</p>
       <p>It was a very hot summer morning but inside the Pyramid it was quite cool. Tom and his classmates just walked into the Pyramid and were very surprised to see what it was like. They went to the Queen’s Room. They saw a passage ( 通道). At the end of it there was a small room. Their teacher told them that they couldn’t go into that room, because it was newly found. Tom looked towards the passage. Two of his friends Jason and Peter saw him and said “Don’t get into trouble, Tom!” when nobody was looking, Tom went up the dark passage, opened the door and walked into it. Suddenly the door closed behind him. The room was very dark, but Tom was luck that he brought a little torch (手电筒 ) with him. When he turned it on, he saw two white</p>
       <p>faces in front of him. “Oh, no!” he cried and ran to the door. He quickly opened it and went down the passage to the Queen’s Room as fast as he could. 布) off their faces and walked slowly down the passage. They couldn’t stop laughing. “That will teach him a lesson,” said Jason.</p>
       <p>根据短文意思，选择最佳答案。</p>

       <p>Do you drink water every day? Drinking water is good for our health. There are some scientific(科学的) ways of drinking water.</p>
       <p>It is the best medicine to drink two glasses of water in the morning. We must</p>
       <p>drink clean water and drink the water that has not been boiled. Maybe Many people think boiled water is safe and good to people’s health. In fact, it is not true. The</p>
       <p>boiling point of water is 100℃. By boiling it, most germs in water can be killed. In the past, the water was less polluted, so boiling was a good way to make clean water. But heavy metals(金属) and other dangerous things in today’s water are much more</p>
       <p>terrible than bacteria. Boiling doesn’t solve that problem. And boiling water may give us more of the dangerous things in our glass. So we must never use soft drinks to take the place of water. We must drink water in the right time. Even in winter, Water is also needed, too.</p>
       <p>Why do we must drink water in the right time? After getting up in the morning, you have less water in your body, because you weren’t drinking for the whole night. So you should drink some water to keep your health after getting up in the morning. That can prevent high blood pressure（防止高血压）, cerebral hemorrhages(脑溢血)，and so on. Drinking water at about 10 a.m. helps your body keep enough water. Drinking water at about 3 p.m. can clean out the wastes in your body. About eight o’clock in the evening is the best time to drink water. Your blood gets thicker when you sleep. Water will make your blood less thick.</p>
       <p>Besides, we should drink 2L water every day. Water is so important for our life. We should drink water often.</p>
       <p>根据短文内容，判断下列句子正（T）误（F）。</p>
       <p>13. Drinking water is the best medicine in our lives.</p>
       <p>14. We mustn’t drink no-boiled water at night.</p>
       <p>15. We should drink boiled water because there are no germs in the boiled water.</p>

       <p>Passage 1</p>
       <p>Henry was an office worker in a big city. He worked very hard and enjoyed traveling in his holidays.</p>
       <p>He usually went to the seaside, but one year he saw an advertisement in a newspaper. “Enjoy country life. Spend a few weeks at West Hill Farm. Good food. Fresh air. Horse riding. Walking. Fishing. Cheap and interesting.”</p>
       <p>“This sounds a good idea,” he thought. “I’ll spend a month at West Hill Farm. I think I can enjoy horse riding, walking and fishing. They’ll make a change from sitting by the seaside and swimming.”</p>
       <p>He wrote to the farmer. In the letter he said that he would like to spend all of July there. Then on the first of July, he left for West Hill Farm.</p>
       <p>But four days later, he returned home.</p>
       <p>“What was wrong with West Hill Farm?” his best friend, Ed, asked him. “Didn’t you enjoy country life?”</p>
       <p>“Country life was very good,” Henry said. “But there was another problem.” “Oh. What?”</p>
       <p>“Well,” he said, “the first day I was there a sheep died, and we had roast mutton for dinner.” “What's wrong with that?” Ed asked. “Fresh meat is the best.”</p>
       <p>“I know, but on the second day a cow died, and we had roast beef for dinner.” “Lucky you!”</p>
       <p>“You don't understand,” Henry said. “On the third day a pig died and we had roast pork for dinner.”</p>
       <p>“A different meat every day,” Ed said loudly, “ and you are complaining!”</p>
       <p>“Let me finish,” Henry said. “On the fourth day the farmer died, and I didn't dare (敢)stay for dinner!”</p>
       <p>1.Which is the best title for the passage?</p>

       <p>Passage 2</p>
       <p>It seems to be strange to you there is a blind spot (盲点)on the eyes. Here is an interesting experiment (实验) that can make something disappear, when one eye is open.</p>
       <p>Make a card about the size of a postcard and write two English letters L and R on it, L on the left and R on the right. First, hold the card about 80 cm away and you see both the letters. Then close your right eye and look at the letter R only with your left eye. And now, as you move the card slowly towards you, you’ll find the letter L disappearing. But if you move the card nearer to your face, the letter will be seen again. Now do the same experiment with your left eye closed, you’ll find the letter R disappearing.</p>
       <p>Why does the letter disappear? It is because there is a blind spot on the eye. When the image (影像) of the letter falls on the blind spot, it won’t be seen. That is why either of the letters disappears.</p>
       <p>5. The passage mainly (主要) tells us _______.</p>
       <p>A. how to find the blind spot B. an interesting experiment</p>
       <p>C. where the blind spot is D. there is blind spot on the eye</p>
       <p>Passage 2 【答案与解析】这篇科普说明文通过一个简易的小实验，证实了人的眼睛里有一个盲点。当外界物体的影像落在盲点上时，人就看不见该物体了。</p>
       <p>5.D。通篇考虑短文，可知D为最佳答案。这由文首一句及“67It is because there is a blind spot on the eye.”也可得出。</p>

       <p>I have loved my mother’s desk since I was just tall enough to see above the top of it as Mother sat doing letters. Standing by her chair, looking at the ink bottle, pens, and white paper, I decided that the act of wring must be the most wonderful thing in the world</p>
       <p>Years later, during her final illness, Mother kept different things for my sister and brother. “But the desk,” she’d said again, “ is for Elizabeth.”</p>
       <p></p>
       <p>I never saw her angry, never saw her cry. I knew she loved me; she showed it in action. But as a young girl, I wanted heart-to-heart talks between mother and daughter.</p>
       <p>They never happened. And a gulf opened between us. I was “too emotional.” But she lived “ on the surface”.</p>
       <p>As years passed and I had my own family. I loved my mother and thanked her for our happy family. I wrote in careful words and asked her to let me know in any way she chose that she did forgive me.</p>
       <p>I posted the letter and waited for her answer. None came.</p>
       <p>My hope turned to disappointment, then little interest and, finally, peace, it seemed that nothing</p>
       <p>happened. I couldn’t be sure that the letter had even got to Mother. I only knew that I had written it, and I could stop trying to make her into someone she was not.</p>
       <p>Now the present of her desk told me, as she had never been able to, that she was pleased that writing was my chosen work. I cleaned the desk carefully and found some papers inside― a photo of my father and a one-page letter, folded and refolded many times.</p>
       <p>Give me an answer, my letter asks, in any way you choose. Mother, you always chose the act that speaks louder than words.</p>

The new ball was made up of 32 pieces of three colors: red, blue and white. Interestingly enough, the French national flag happened to be in three colors, too. Besides, 32 teams took part in the coming World Cup. But early football was made up of eight pieces of leather. As time went by, more pieces of leather were used, from 12 pieces to 18 to 26 and then to 32 now.</p>
       <p>About three million such new footballs were made. And then some players were playing the new ball in their training. The makers have warned the goalkeeper that the new ball flies in a direct line at a fast speed.</p>
       <p>After trying the ball for some time, a footballer said that the ball was quite different from the traditional (传统的) black and white one, and that the goalkeeper would find it harder to catch them. Another footballer said that there would be more goals. “For the player on the ground, the new ball is easier to control as it flies. A good player can shoot in more goals,” he said.</p>

       <p>C. Goalkeepers and Players D. Three-color Flag of France</p>
       <p></p>
       <p>【答案与解析】这篇短文的大意是：1998年在法国举行的世界杯足球赛实行了新的规则。比赛中使用红、白、黄三色相间的球。这种球由32块皮革缝制而成，十分凑巧的是，当时正好有32支球队参赛。足球制造商在此之前提醒守门员，说这种球沿直线飞行，速度极快。试用一段时间之后，球员发现这种球与传统的黑白相间的二色球有很大不同。这种球更容易控制，但守门员很难抓到，在一场球赛中有可能进更多的球。</p>
       <p></p>
       <p>1.A。全文围绕这种由32块皮制成的红、白、蓝相间的新式足球作了详细的介绍，故答案非A莫属。</p>

       <p>Have you ever rubbed your hands together when they get cold? things that aren’t very smooth rub together to make heat energy. The</p>
       <p>faster you rub two things together, the more friction (and heat) you can</p>
       <p>make. Let’s discover friction!</p>
       <p>WHAT YOU’LL NEED:</p>
       <p>&middot;Soap &middot;Water &middot;Your hands!</p>
       <p>WHAT TO DO:</p>
       <p>1. Make sure your hands are dirty.</p>
