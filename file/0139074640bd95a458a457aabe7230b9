      <h2> 　　对卓别林的评价英文篇一</h2> 
      <p> 　　Charlie Chaplin was born on April 16, 1889 in London. Her father was an entertainer and although not one of the big names, he was doing very well. Her mother Hannah was also an entertainer. A wonderful mimic, she had a sweet, charming voice. While they were by no means[1] rich, the music hall provided the Chaplins with a comfortable living.</p> 
      <p> 　　Unfortunately happy life didn't last long. Father's alcoholism was slowly, but surely destroying his marriage. Finally it ended in divorce, but Hannah was indomitable[2]. Without her, Charlie Chaplin would have become just one more child lost in the poverty of Victorian London. Somehow she not only managed to keep Charlie and his brother Syney clean and warm, clothed and fed but she conjured[3] little treats for them. She would sit at the window watching the passersby and guess at their characters from the way they looked and behaved, spinning tales to delight Charlie and Syney. Charlie took in her skills and went on using them all his life.</p> 
      <p> 　　Charlie had always believed, even in the worst times, that had something special locked away inside him. He took his courage and went to see one of the top theatrical agents. With no experience at all, he was being offered the plum part[4] of Billy-- the pageboy in a new production of &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;. &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; opened on July 27, 1903 at the enormous &quot;Pavilion Theatre&quot; Charlie seemed to change overnight. It was as if he had found the thing he was meant to do.</p> 
      <p> 　　It was, by now, 1908, Charlie was nineteen and he fell in love. Hetty Kelly was only fifteen. But her parents quashed[5] the the romance before it really begun-- but the memory of pretty Hetty stayed with Charlie all his life.</p> 
      <p> 　　In 1910, when Karno set off on his yearly American tour, &quot;One of the best pantomime[6] artists ever seen here.&quot; They had reached Philadelphia when a telegram arrived and he was being offered the chance to replace a star in the Keystone film company.</p> 
      <p> 　　Cinema was born in the same year as Charlie thought people still believed it was a passing fad, and would never replace live shows. He was kept hanging about[7] for several weeks and he used the time to watch and to learn. He was determined to master this new medium. It offered him the chance of money and success -- and it would set him free from the unpredictability of live audience.</p> 
      <p> 　　Charlie's first film, released in February 1914, was called &quot;Making a living&quot;. Though it didn't satisfy Charlie, the public liked it. After that he had made ten films and he had learned a lot. The public loved him and distributors were demanding more and more Chaplin films. In an incredibly short time, Charlie had become a very important man in motion picture...</p>

      <p> 　　His mother Hannah was an entertainer, a wonderful mimic; she had a sweet, charming voice. His father was also an entertainer and although not one of the big names, he was doing very well. While they were by no means rich, the music hall provided the Chaplin with a comfortable living.</p>

      <p> 　　1908, Charlie was nineteen and he fell in love. Hetty Kelly was only fifteen. But her parents quashed the romance before it really begun-- but the memory of pretty Hetty stayed with Charlie all his life.</p> 
      <p> 　　In 1914, World War I had broken out. Chaplin contributed to the war in the best way he knew how-- he made a film &quot;Shoulder Arms&quot;. He made a comedy set in the trenches. The returning troops enjoyed it. Being able to laugh at the insanity of war had been their only real defence. Two days after its release, Charlie married Mildred Harris, pretty in the same way as his first love Hetty Kelly. It was hopeless even from the very start. He had only one way to face such sorrow. He threw himself into work on a new feature-- length film called The Kid. The kid tackled another social concern that deeply upset Charlie Chaplin-- the treatment of abandoned children. The Kid was a success. But Charlie's private world continued to fall apart. In November, 1920, they were officially divorced. In November 1924, Charlie had married his leading lady, Lita Grey. It was no wiser a marriage than his first had been. Despite the turmoil in his private life, Charlie went on and made a film called The Circus.</p> 
      <p> 　　After failure of the third marriage in 1942, He had met a young woman, the daughter of the great American playwright, Eugene O'Neill. She was only 17 years old and she and Charlie had fallen deeply in love. Her name was Oona. And now it was</p> 
      <p> 　　1945, after the world II, America had become affected by a kind of madness, an obsessive fear and hatred of Communism. Charlie become the victim of this persecution. Against this atmosphere of persecution he set to work on a new film. The film was Limelight, the story of an aging music hall performer and the young girl he helps to success. Into it he put his memories of the London and the theatrical life he had known as a boy. America's anti-communist emotions had found a new and more lunatic voice. On his way to London for its premiere. The US Attorney General had forbidden Chaplin re-entry to the United States. He was an exile.</p> 
      <p> 　　He was received warmly in London and hailed as a genius. In the US, the vicious attacks continued, Charlie couldn't go back, and the family left for Switzerland. In January 1953, they settled in the beautiful house at Corsier-sur-Vevey that was to be Charlie's home for the rest of his life.</p> 
      <p> 　　If America had denounced Charlie, he had his family-- and the acclaim of the rest of the world.</p> 
      <h2> 　　对卓别林的评价英文篇三</h2> 
      <p> 　　Charles Spencer Chaplin was born on 16 April 1889, in East Street, Walworth, London, England. His parents were both entertainers in the music hall tradition.</p> 
      <p> 　　His father was a vocalist and an actor and his mother was a singer and an actress who went by the stage name Lilly Harley.They separated before Charlie was three. He learned singing from his parents. Chaplin's father was an alcoholic and had little contact with his son.</p> 
      <p> 　　First years in the United States (1910C1916)</p> 
      <p> 　　Chaplin first toured the United States with the Fred Karno troupe(卡尔诺哑剧剧团) from 1910 to 1912. After five months back in England, he returned to the U.S. for a second tour.</p> 
      <p> 　　In late 1913, Chaplin‘s act with the Karno Troupe was seen by Mack Sennett, Mabel Normand, Minta Durfee, and Fatty Arbuckle. Sennett hired him for his studio, the Keystone Film Company .</p> 
      <p> 　　Chaplin had considerable initial difficulty adjusting to the demands of film acting and his performance suffered for it. After Chaplin's first film appearance, Making a Living was filmed, Sennett felt he had made a costly mistake.</p> 
      <p> 　　Chaplin believed Sennett intended to fire him. However, Chaplin's pictures were soon a success, and he became one of the biggest stars at Keystone.</p> 
      <p> 　　Pioneering film artist and global celebrity (1916C1918)</p> 
      <p> 　　In 1916, the Mutual Film Corporation paid Chaplin US$670,000 to produce a dozen comedies. He was given near complete artistic control, and produced twelve films over an eighteen-month period that rank among the most influential comedy films in all cinema.</p> 
      <p> 　　Practically every Mutual comedy is a classic: Easy Street, One AM, The Pawnshop, and The Adventurer are perhaps the best known.</p> 
      <p> 　　In 1916, the Mutual Film Corporation paid Chaplin US$670,000 to produce a dozen comedies. He was given near complete artistic control, and produced twelve films over an eighteen-month period that rank among the most influential comedy films in all cinema.</p> 
      <p> 　　Practically every Mutual comedy is a classic: Easy Street, One AM, The Pawnshop, and The Adventurer are perhaps the best known.</p> 
      <p> 　　Although First National expected Chaplin to deliver short comedies like the celebrated Mutuals, Chaplin ambitiously expanded most of his personal projects</p> 
      <p> 　　into longer, feature-length films.</p> 
      <p> 　　United Artists (1919C1939)</p> 
      <p> 　　In 1919, Chaplin co-founded the United Artists film distribution company .</p> 
      <p> 　　All Chaplin‘s United Artists pictures were of feature length, beginning with the atypical(非典型的) drama in which Chaplin had only a brief cameo role(小配角), A Woman of Paris (1923). This was followed by the classic comedies The Gold Rush (1925) and The Circus (1928).</p> 
      <p> 　　After the arrival of sound films, Chaplin continued to focus on silent films; The Circus (1928), City Lights (1931), and Modern Times (1936) were essentially silent films scored with his own music and sound effects.</p> 
      <p> 　　Chaplin‘s first talking picture, The Great Dictator (1940 ) was an act of defiance(反抗，蔑视) against Nazism.</p> 
      <p> 　　He was nominated for Academy awards for Best Picture (producer), Best Original Screenplay (writer) and Best Actor in The Great Dictator.</p> 
      <p> 　　Final works (1957C1976)</p> 
      <p> 　　Chaplin's final two films were made in London: A King in New York (1957) in which he starred, wrote, directed and produced; and A Countess from Hong Kong (1967), which he directed, produced, and wrote.</p> 
      <p> 　　As well as directing these final films, Chaplin also wrote My Autobiography, between 1959 and 1963, which was published in 1964.</p> 
      <p> 　　From 1969 until 1976, Chaplin wrote original music compositions and scores(电影配乐) for his silent pictures and re-released them. Chaplin‘s last completed work was the score for his 1923 film A Woman of Paris, which was completed in 1976, by which time Chaplin was extremely frail(虚弱的), even finding communication difficult.<br /> &nbsp;</p>
