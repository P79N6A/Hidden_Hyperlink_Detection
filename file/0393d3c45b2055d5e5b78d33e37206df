				    <h1>What does Brexit mean for the UK cloud industry?</h1>
Join us <strong><a href="http://eurocloud.org.uk/_m1723/events">July 20th for an after-work discussion</a></strong> of the impact on Brexit on UK cloud providers. With expert speakers from law firms Osborne Clarke and Wallace LLP, EuroCloud UK and the opportunity to hear views from and network with a cross-section of UK cloud providers. &gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<a href="http://eurocloud.org.uk/_m1723/events">See more details and register on our events page</a>. <br />
<br />
The UK's formal withdrawal from the EU vastly increases the role of informal ties that organizations such as EuroCloud can broker and co-ordinate. EuroCloud UK will act as a valuable information resource for UK cloud leaders on European policy, cloud strategies and market trends to help inform their decision-making. This relates both to trading with the EU and in domestic UK regulation and policy. We also provide networking and links into markets across Europe through our connections to the various national EuroClouds.<br />
